Real-time bus tracking system for Rajalakshmi Institute of Technology (RIT) — built using Flask (Python), MySQL, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript.
This project enables drivers to share live GPS, and students to track their bus in real-time.

 1. Overview
This project solves a real problem for college students — no more waiting for the bus blindly.
The system has three interfaces:

 Driver
Shares live GPS every few seconds
The backend stores the location in MySQL
The system logs arrival when bus reaches within 50m radius of campus

 Student
Can select their route number
Sees bus movement LIVE on Google Maps
Updated every few seconds

Admin
Manage buses, drivers, routes
View arrival logs
Monitor live status

2. Features
Live Bus Tracking
Drivers send continuous GPS coordinates which are displayed to students in real-time.
GPS Sharing
Driver page uses the browser’s GPS API to capture location.

REST API
Clean Flask endpoints for live location updates and fetching latest bus location.

Haversine Distance Calculation
Used to check when the bus reaches college (arrival logs).

Google Maps Integration
Students get a clean, smooth, interactive map showing bus movement.

🗄 MySQL Database
Stores bus info, live locations, and arrival logs.

🏗 3. Project Architecture (Backend + Frontend)
Backend (Flask):
API receives location (/api/update_location)
Validates data
Stores in MySQL
Applies Haversine formula
Detects arrival within 50m
Sends JSON response back to frontend

Frontend (HTML + JS):

Driver Page:
Gets current GPS
Sends it to backend using fetch() API
Start/Stop sharing buttons

Student Page:
Loads Google Map
Fetches latest location
Updates marker position live

Database (MySQL):
buses → route, bus number
live_locations → every GPS update
arrival_logs → arrival timestamps
